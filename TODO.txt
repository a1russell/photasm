TODO:
=====

* Implement methods to sync metadata between filesystem and database.

* Try overriding add_view and change_view in PhotoAdmin and changing the form
  to PhotoUploadForm or PhotoEditForm before the call to super. Does this
  introduce concurrency problems?  Maybe try implementing a ModelForm with a 
  field getter that returns different fields depending on add or change.

* Write docstrings, including for the model properties.

* Create a template for 404s, etc.

* Figure out how to create temporary test images with PIL.

* In test.py::
  
    import photasm.photos.image_metadata
    __test__ = {
        'image_metadata': image_metadata,
    }

* Implement inline formset for PhotoTags.
