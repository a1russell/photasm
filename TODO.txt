=====

* Figure out how to create temporary test images with PIL.

* Automated unit tests.

* In test.py::
  
    import photasm.photos.image_metadata
    __test__ = {
        'image_metadata': image_metadata,
    }

* Remove tests for _metadata_value_synced_with_file,
  _sync_metadata_value_to_file?

* Implement inline formset for PhotoTags and Albums on the Photo form.

* Implement ZIP uploading for albums. Experiment with multi-file forms.
