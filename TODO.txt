TODO:
=====

* In PhotoAdmin.save_model, check if obj.data changes, not just change param.

* Write docstrings, including for the model properties.

* Create 404.html (page not found) and 500.html (server error).

* Figure out how to create temporary test images with PIL.

* In test.py::
  
    import photasm.photos.image_metadata
    __test__ = {
        'image_metadata': image_metadata,
    }

* Implement inline formset for PhotoTags and Albums on the Photo form.

* Implement ZIP uploading for albums. Experiment with multi-file forms.
